## Concepts
1. **TCP**
- Works at lower level (TCP layer)
- Sends/receives raw bytes
- No knowledge of URLs, headers
- Great for tunneling / flexibility
2. **HTTP**
- Built on top of TCP
- Sends/receives structured HTTP requests
- Knows about methods, headers, routes, etc.
- Easier for web APIs, browsers, etc.
