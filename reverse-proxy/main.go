// A reverse proxy is like a middleman between a client and your backend server. But unlike a forward proxy (which sits in front of the client), the reverse proxy sits in front of your servers, and clients think they're talking to the main server â€” when really, the proxy is just passing stuff back and forth
// Think of it as the bouncer at a club. People (clients) come to the front, talk to the bouncer (reverse proxy), and the bouncer decides:
// Who gets in
// Where they go (User service? Payment? Auth?)
// Maybe even adds some checks (ID = auth, rate-limits, logs)
// main is the entry point of the program. It sets up a reverse proxy using the Fiber framework.
